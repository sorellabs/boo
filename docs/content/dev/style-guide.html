§§ blurb
OrpheOS's coding guidelines are based on three main points
(*style-triforce, yay*), which strives to make source code more
readable:

- conciseness
- natural flow of readability
- descriptiveness. 

This document outlines how the code is structured and laid out to
achieve these goals.
§§ /blurb


## Introduction

OrpheOS's source code should be sweet, readable and beautiful. And
that's what these conventions are for. Surely most of it will be biased
or subjective, but I've tried my best to include my reasoning for every
one of them.

You may or may not agree with them (and it would be interesting to
discuss these points, in case you don't agree), but those are the
conventions OrpheOS follows, so if you want to hack in, be sure to
understand these and put them to good use :3



## Layout

### Line length

> All lines of code should have less than 80 characters.
> All lines of comments should have less than 72 characters.

You may ask **why be so goddamn restrictive nowadays?**. Yes, we don't
use those limited terminals that could only display 25 lines with 80
characters each at a time. *We use such big wide screens nowadays, for
fucks sake, keeping it to 80 characters is stupid*.

Well, not really. The limit of 80 characters is based on these items:

-   It's difficult to keep track of the whole context while going back
    and forth through a long line of code.

-   If the lines are too long, you loose the ability of having another
    screen of code, side-by-side, to analyse other sections that are
    relevant to the current context.
   
    On Emacs, I can have two windows, leave the right one for the code
    I'm working on, and split the left one vertically to use it to
    display related functions, documentation and such.
   
-   While striving for shorter lines of code, you're forced to remove the
    complexity of a line, which in turn increases readability.
   
-   Shorter lines make it difficult to have run-on code lines, and forces
    you to organise these in visually nice patterns which are also
    quicker to recognise and grasp.
  
  
### Vertical Space

> All functions should be self-contained in 21 lines.

That is, functions should be "black boxes" that you can understand (on
the surface) by reading its source code alone. If you have to refer to
several other parts to understand what's going on with a function,
something is very, very wrong.

The number of lines is not arbitrary, 21 lines is about what you have in
one terminal screen, if you take out the status bar and the menu
bar. And I believe that functions should be fully visible in one
screenful.

Again, there are reasons for this:

-   Having to scroll either up or down to understand a function is
    **bad**.
   
    Not only it's annoying, but if you have to review something you have
    to scroll back up and find the place you were once again.
   
-   Functions with more than 21 lines are too complex to actually
    understand.
   
    Having a low limit force people to think about abstractions, which in
    turn leads to more readable and maintainable code.


### Indentation

> 4 spaces for indentation. No tabs, whatsoever.

The 4-space indentation is what I found to be ideal. 2-width indentation
looks pretty confusing in JavaScript, and make it harder to get a good
outline of the structure.

8-width indentation, on the other hand, wastes too much horizontal
space, making it rather difficult to keep down the 80-characters
limit.

On the subjective side, I find such long gaps ugly, and makes the
structure seem more important than the contents.


### Alignment

> Properly aligned assignments.

There's quite some discussion in properly aligned code — eg.: aligning
assignment values. Some say they add additional stress on your eyes. I
believe tabulated data increases the readability, by making it easier
and faster to check which values correspond to which key in a long list
of data — although they don't apply to rather small ones.

I decided in favour of proper alignment because it looks visually nice,
and makes long list of data — like object literals — far more
readable. Small lists are aligned for consistency:

~~~js~~~
pos    = [0,   0]
size   = [100, 100]
weight = 10.2
~~~~~~~~


### Literals

#### Arrays and Objects

> Comma-first style, properly aligned with the opening bracket, a single
> space separating symbols from content, unless it's a one-liner.

Comma-first allows you to easily spot which of the lines create a new
item, and are also good for item insertion.

~~~js~~~
[ 'Alice'
, 'Red Queen'
, 'White Queen'
, 'White Rabbit' ]
~~~~~~~

The extra whitespace is included to break a bit from the clutter — and
to make a source more readable you have to reduce both useless noises
and code complexity.

Objects follow the same principles, only the keys and values are to be
properly aligned according to the assignment rules:

~~~js~~~
{ x:     15
, y:     10
, angle: 45 }
~~~~~~~~

The only exception for the extra whitespace is the one-liner
Object/Array literal:

~~~js~~~
var x = [1, 2, 3]
var y = {foo: bar, me: 'you'}
~~~~~~~



#### Strings

> Single quotes, properly aligned in "multi-line" strings.

Single quotes were chosen for the same motive the extra whitespace is
required in object literals: remove clutter.

~~~js~~~
var foo = 'Multi-line strings are not really supported '
        + 'in JavaScript, thus explicit concatenation '
        + 'should be used to improve readability.'
~~~~~~~~


## Code Complexity

Code complexity and readability don't go well together, plus complex
pieces of code hide away bugs more easily, and we sure don't want that.

We can reduce code complexity with refactoring, and can somehow
workaround it a bit by documenting a complicated piece of code.


### Documenting

Good documentation is hard to do and keep up-to-date, but it's also one
of the most important aspects when reading a source code. The source
tells you **how** stuff gets done, the documentation tells you
**why** such stuff needs to be done — or at least it should, otherwise
you're just repeating yourself for no benefits.

There's also a difference between API documentation, developer usage
documentation and user documentation. All those three should get some
love too.


#### API documentation

The API documentation should contemplate the following aspects of a
given source code block:

-  **Why that code exists**
   — what's supposed to do.

-  **The implications of running that code**
   — does it have any side-effects? Does it throw any errors? Is it
   dependant on something else?

-  **Related pieces of code**
   — blocks that do some similar work (perhaps in a more high-level way)
   or that are related in any way.
   
-  **Expectations**
   — what kind of parameters or state it expects, and what the caller
   should expect to get back from it.


So, given that, we need to define what is a code-block. A code-block is
any self-contained functionality. In JavaScript, it's usually a
`Function`, an `Object` or a `Module`. 

The documentation should be placed right before the code-block, *not
inside it*. The rationale is that adding comments inside the code-block
makes it difficult to understand the *how things get done*, and
conflicts with the 21-lines rule.

The following are some good and bad examples of API documentation for
the given piece of code:

~~~js~~~
function add_callback(promise, event, callback) {
    return callback? get_queue(promise, event).push(callback)
                   : null
}
~~~~~~~

Good — tells you the purpose of the codes, and the implications of using
it:

~~~js~~~
//// Function add_callback ////////////////////////////
//
//   Promise:promise  Str:event  Fn:callback? -> Num?
//
// Adds a callback to handle the given event.
//
// The callback will be called whenever \`event\` happens
// within the given promise.
//
// The arguments passed to the callback are the same
// ones provided when the promise was fulfilled.
//
// \`this\` inside the callback will refer to the
// promise object.
//
// :see also:
//    * \`flush\` — how callbacks are called
//
// :warning: side-effects
//     The list of callbacks is modified in-place.
~~~~~~~    
    
Bad — tells you how the code does something, and nothing besides that:

~~~js~~~
//// Function add_callback ////////////////////////////
//
//   Promise:promise  Str:event  Fn:callback? -> Num?
//
// When called with a callback, inserts that callback
// at the end of the queue for the given event, then
// returns the new length of the event queue.
//
// If the callback is null, does nothing.
~~~~~~~~

The details on the documentation format expected are defined in the
[Calliope][] project. The project also defines guidelines for end-user
and developer usage documentation, which are entirely out of the scope
of this style guide.


### Reducing expressions

> Always name large or complex expressions/actions. Either by assigning
> them to a variable or by using a named function.


Large expressions are hard to read, and so are chunks of run-on
code. For abstracting them, and making it easier to associate an
expression with what it means, complex expressions should be named.

In some cases, this means assigning it to a variable, in others,
creating a new function that names a process.

For example, the following piece of code:

~~~js~~~
if ((!field.value && !field.checked) || field.hasAttribute('data-special'))
    execute_black_magic()
~~~~~~~~

Can be rewritten as:

~~~js~~~
function emptyp(field)  { return !field.value && !field.checked)    }
function specialp(field){ return field.hasAttribute('data-special') }

if (emptyp(field) || specialp(field))
    execute_black_magic()
~~~~~~~

This explicitly separates the qualities that defines a field, by naming
them, and therefore makes it easier to grasp what's happening in the
conditional — don't show just the *how*, convey the intent
of the code as well.
   

### Naming

> All lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Except for
> constructors, which should use CamelCase.


OrpheOS follows a naming convention derived from Scheme/Common Lisp,
Python and regular JavaScript. Mostly due to the fact CamelCased stuff
makes it hard for me to read — yes, I need some breath between words.

Words are *usually* separated with underscores — since JavaScript does
not accept hyphens in identifiers, — with the sole exception of
Constructors, which use CamelCase.

Names should be concise, while still descriptive and meaningful. Avoid
abbreviations — they don't make the name concise, just shorter. Try not
having names larger than 10 characters though, unless it's strictly
proven that there's no better alternative. Always look for a good
synonym or phrase that express the same idea though.

Good names:

~~~text~~~
next\_event
flush
reload
~~~~~~~~~~

Bad names:

~~~text~~~
get\_next\_item\_in\_the\_frame   // too long
fireEvents                   // camel case
find\_recursive\_func\_in\_ast   // too long + abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~

#### Variables

Describe the value a variable hold, **not the data structure** it
uses. So, `stack`, `queue` and such are bad names. Hungarian notation
will warrant you an insta-kill :3


#### Constants

Constants are in no way different from variables in JavaScript,
therefore should not be handled differently either.

Actually, some engines do support `const` for real constants, but even
so, they're just naming a value, so I don't feel they should get any
special names. Plus, the usual conventions for constants suck.


#### Functions

Describe the actions that are carried out by a procedure. Avoid stupid
`get/set` prefixes in names, unless they actually mean
something. Usually you expect a function to return a value, and the name
of the function alone should tell you when you're setting something.

If a function abstracts the act of creating an object, prefix it with
`make_`. So, a function that constructs a `Promise` object would be
named `make_promise`.

The only exception to this rule is the function for removing the library
from the global scope, which does not actually construct an object —
albeit returns one, — and which is named `make_local`.


#### Predicates

Predicates, that is, things for which the result is intended to be used
as a boolean, should end with a `p`. So, `emptyp` would define whether
or not something is empty. `specialp` would define whether or not
something is special.

Again, I would prefer to use a question mark (`?`), but that was already
taken by the ternaries.


#### Destructive

Destructive functions, that is, those which modify the arguments they
receive in-place, should start with a `n`. So, a sort function that
executes in-place, should be named `nsort`. Though Common Lisp define
this as a `non-consing function`, you can just think of it as a
`not-safe function`.

And yes, I would also rather use an exclamation mark (`!`) here... 


#### Abbreviations

Though abbreviations should be avoided, a few of them are widely enough
used in computer science that we can embrace them without loosing much
on the readability side, while gaining a few more in neatness and
horizontal screen space.


Abbreviation | Meaning
------------ | -------
arg          | argument (function parameter)
attr         | attribute
bin          | binary
bool         | boolean
cat          | concatenate
char         | character
ctx          | context (usually, the `this` object)
doc          | document
elm          | element (an HTMLElement instance, usually)
fn           | function
hex          | hexadecimal
id           | identifier
int          | integer
max          | maximum
min          | minimum
num          | number
obj          | object
oct          | octal
pred         | predicate
prop         | property
seq          | sequence
str          | string
substr       | sub-string


## Readability

### Braces

> Braces should never be left alone in a line of their own.

Braces starting a block of code should be placed in the same line as the
statement that starts such a block. Likewise, braces ending a block of
code should be placed in the same line as the statement that ends such
block, unless the block happens to be a top-level function — that is, a
function that defines an independent functionality.

Good:

~~~js~~~
function add(event, callback) {
    function insert_callback() {
        if (this.value)  fire(this, event, callback)
        else             add_callback(this, event, callback) }

    if (fnp(event)) {
        callback = event
        event    = this.default_event }
    insert_callback.call(this)
    return this
}
~~~~~~~

Notice that the if-block and the internal function closing braces are
all put in the same line as their last statements, however, the closing
function's one is put in a line of itself.

This additional "wasted" line is used to add a distinction for
self-contained and use-able functionality.


Bad:

~~~js~~~
function add(event, callback) {
    function insert_callback() {
        if (this.value) {
            fire(this, event, callback)
        }
        else {
            add_callback(this, event, callback)
        }
    }

    if (fnp(event)) {
        callback = event
        event    = this.default_event
    }
    
    insert_callback.call(this)
    return this
}
~~~~~~~

Not only it wastes four of those lines just to place noises (braces),
making the line count go up to whooping 19 lines — almost the
vertical-line limit, — It also makes the function look more complex than
it actually is.

Also, leaving more noises decrease the readability.


### Semicolons

> Use new lines to end your statements. Never use semicolons!

Seriously, don't use semicolons. Ever. They only add useless noises to
each line, decreasing the overall readability of the whole program.

And since we're relying in ASI, as a rule of thumb, don't start your
lines with `[`, `(`, `/`, `+` and `-`, unless implicit line continuation
is what you're aiming at.

You don't need extraneous parenthesis for functions that'll be called
after their definition when you're already inside an expression
(eg.: assignment and function parameters). For all the other cases you
should force an expression using the `void` operator.


### Function hoisting

> Rely on function hoisting when it makes sense to have additional
> information associated with a function, so such information is
> not lost god-knows-how-many-lines far away the function.

Function hoisting is one of the most awesome things to abuse in
JavaScript, and something OrpheOS component's source code do
to the infinity.

Basically, function hoisting allows you to have meta-data, or
some kind of transformation information that should be associated
with a function, to come before the physical definition of
such function in the source code. Kinda like Python's `@decorators`,
therefore making the flow of readability more natural.

For example, it's used a lot for inheritance:

~~~js~~~
inherits(Apprentice, Mage.prototype)
function Apprentice(name) {
    Mage.call(this, name)
    /* define Apprentice's properties here */
}
~~~~~~~

This allows you to quickly grasp that Apprentice inherits properties
from Mage.prototype, which would not be as easy to notice if the
inheritance declaration was somewhere 30 lines of code away from the
function declaration.

It's also used for defining function's prototypes, so you have an
easy list of properties that will actually end up in the constructed
object:

~~~js~~~
inherits(Apprentice, Mage.prototype)
function Apprentice(name) {
    Mage.call(this, name)
    /* instance definitions */
}
Apprentice.prototype = function() {
    return extend( Aprentice.prototype
                 , with_traits(BlackMage)
                 
                 , { cast:     cast
                   , meditate: meditate
                   , guard:    guard  })


    function cast() {
        /* ... */
    }
    function meditate() {
        /* ... */
    }
    function guard() {
        /* ... */
    }
}()
~~~~~~~


### Blank lines

Use blank lines sparingly to group related group of functionality.
Doing such makes both it easier to spot what kind of stuff is related
to what, and make it easier on the eyes by allowing the reader to
breath a little while reading some code.

You could say it's analogous to paragraphs in your usual fiction books.
